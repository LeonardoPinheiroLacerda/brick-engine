== Objective

The **Brick Engine** is a modular, TypeScript-based game engine designed for creating retro grid-based games (like Tetris, Snake, Breakout) that run in a browser. It leverages **P5.js** for rendering and simulates the experience of a classic handheld gaming device, complete with a dot-matrix style display, a HUD (Head-Up Display), and physical button controls.

== Key Features

* **Grid-Based Logic**: Built-in support for 2D grid management, collision detection, and row/column manipulations.
* **Retro Aesthetic**: Simulates a physical device with customizable colors and responsive layout.
* **Modular Architecture**: core functionality is split into distinct modules (Grid, Control, Renderer, State, Text, Time, Score) for clean separation of concerns.
* **Input Handling**: Unified control system supporting keyboard and on-screen button inputs.
* **Game Loop**: Separated logic ticks (game speed) from rendering frames (60fps smooth animations).
* **Debugger**: Built-in real-time state inspector. See xref:docs/reference/modules/Debugger.adoc[Debugger Reference].

== Installation
 
Install the package via npm:
 
[source,bash]
----
npm install brick-engine p5
npm install --save-dev @types/p5
----
 
== Getting Started

To create a game, you must extend the abstract `Game` class and implement its core abstract methods: `getPersistenceKey`, `setupGame`, `update`, `render`, `drawTitleScreen`, and `drawGameOverScreen`.

=== Example

[source,typescript]
----
import { Game, FontSize, ControlKey, ControlEventType } from 'brick-engine-js';

export default class MyGame extends Game {
    
    // 1. Setup: Called once after engine initialization
    setupGame(): void {
        // Initialize your game state here
        this.modules.text.setTextSize(FontSize.MEDIUM);
        
        // Subscribe to controls
        this.modules.control.subscribe(ControlKey.ACTION, ControlEventType.PRESSED, () => {
             console.log('Action pressed!');
        });
    }

    // 2. Game Logic: Called every game tick (controlled by tickInterval)
    update(deltaTime: number): void {
        if (!this.modules.state.isPlaying()) return;
        // ... game logic ...
    }

    // 3. Visual Effects: Called every frame (60fps)
    render(): void {
        // ... visual effects independent of game logic ...
    }

    // 4. Persistence: Unique key for LocalStorage (prevents collisions between games)
    getPersistenceKey(): string {
        return 'my-awesome-game-v1';
    }

    // 5. Title Screen: Rendered when game is ON but not STARTED
    drawTitleScreen(): void {
        this.modules.text.textOnDisplay('MY AWESOME GAME', { x: 0.5, y: 0.3 });
        this.modules.text.textOnDisplay('PRESS START', { x: 0.5, y: 0.7 });
    }

    // 6. Game Over Screen: Rendered when health/lives reach zero
    drawGameOverScreen(): void {
        this.modules.text.textOnDisplay('GAME OVER', { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 });
    }
}
----

== Structure

The engine is organized into the following core modules:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Module | Description

| xref:docs/reference/modules/Game.adoc[Game (Core)]
| The central orchestrator. It initializes the engine, manages the main loop (ticks and frames), and provides access to all other modules.

| xref:docs/reference/modules/GameGrid.adoc[GameGrid]
| Manages the 2D grid data structure. Handles cell values, colors, row/column operations, and collision detection. Includes `GameHudGrid` for custom HUD content.

| xref:docs/reference/modules/GameControl.adoc[GameControl]
| The input system. Abstracts physical keys into virtual actions (UP, DOWN, ACTION) and provides an event subscription API.

| xref:docs/reference/modules/GameRenderer.adoc[GameRenderer]
| Handles visual representation. Draws the grid, cells, and UI elements to the canvas using P5.js.

| xref:docs/reference/modules/GameState.adoc[GameState]
| Tracks global game properties (playing, paused, score) and supports state persistence.

| xref:docs/reference/modules/GameText.adoc[GameText]
| Specialized renderer for drawing retro-style pixelated text on the HUD and main display.

| xref:docs/reference/modules/GameTime.adoc[GameTime]
| Controls game loop timing, separating logic updates (Ticks) from visual rendering (Frames).

| xref:docs/reference/modules/GameSound.adoc[GameSound]
| Manages audio playback using the Web Audio API, supporting simultaneous sounds and volume control.

| xref:docs/reference/modules/GameScore.adoc[GameScore]
| Tracks session score, level logic, and syncs high scores with `GameState`.
