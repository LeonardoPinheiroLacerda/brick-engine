== Objective

The **Brick Engine** is a modular, TypeScript-based game engine designed for creating retro grid-based games (like Tetris, Snake, Breakout) that run in a browser. It leverages **P5.js** for rendering and simulates the experience of a classic handheld gaming device, complete with a dot-matrix style display, a HUD (Head-Up Display), and physical button controls.

== Key Features

* **Grid-Based Logic**: Built-in support for 2D grid management, collision detection, and row/column manipulations.
* **Retro Aesthetic**: Simulates a physical device with customizable colors and responsive layout.
* **Modular Architecture**: core functionality is split into distinct modules (Grid, Control, Renderer, State, Text, Time) for clean separation of concerns.
* **Input Handling**: Unified control system supporting keyboard and on-screen button inputs.
* **Game Loop**: Separated logic ticks (game speed) from rendering frames (60fps smooth animations).

== Engine Lifecycle

The engine follows a strict loop to ensure logic consistency and visual smoothness.

== Getting Started

To create a game, you must extend the abstract `Game` class and implement its three core abstract methods: `setupGame`, `processTick`, and `processFrame`.

=== Example

[source,typescript]
----
import Game from './core/Game';

export default class MyGame extends Game {
    
    // 1. Setup: Called once after engine initialization
    setupGame(): void {
        // Initialize your game state here
        this.modules.state.toggleStart();
        this.modules.text.setTextSize(FontSize.MEDIUM);
    }

    // 2. Game Logic: Called every game tick (controlled by tickInterval)
    // Use this for movement, collision, state limits
    processTick(deltaTime: number): void {
        if (!this.modules.state.running) return;
        
        // ... game logic ...
    }

    // 3. Rendering: Called every frame (60 times per second)
    // Use this for visual effects independent of game logic (particles, animations)
    processFrame(): void {
        // ... visual effects ...
    }
}

== Structure

The engine is organized into the following core modules:

* xref:docs/reference/Game.adoc[Game (Core)]: The central orchestrator. It initializes the engine, manages the main loop (ticks and frames), and provides access to all other modules.
* xref:docs/reference/GameGrid.adoc[GameGrid]: Manages the 2D grid data structure. Handles cell values, colors, row/column operations (clearing, shifting), and collision detection.
* xref:docs/reference/GameControl.adoc[GameControl]: The input system. It abstracts physical keys (keyboard) into virtual actions (UP, DOWN, ACTION) and provides an event subscription API.
* xref:docs/reference/GameRenderer.adoc[GameRenderer]: Handles the visual representation. It draws the grid, cells, and UI elements to the canvas using P5.js context.
* xref:docs/reference/GameState.adoc[GameState]: Tracks global game properties like `running`, `paused`, `muted`, and `score`. Supports state persistence (e.g., saving preferences).
* xref:docs/reference/GameText.adoc[GameText]: A specialized renderer for drawing retro-style pixelated text on the HUD and main display areas.
* xref:docs/reference/GameTime.adoc[GameTime]: Controls the game loop timing. It separates logic updates (Ticks) from visual rendering (Frames) to ensure consistent gameplay speed independent of frame rate.
* xref:docs/reference/GameSound.adoc[GameSound]: Manages audio playback using the **Web Audio API**. Supports multiple simultaneous sounds, volume control, and automatically syncs mute state with `GameState`.
