toc::[]

The `HudRenderer` module renders the Heads-Up Display (HUD), which includes score, level, game status text, and the HUD grid. It implements the `Renderer` interface and is managed by `GameRenderer`.

== Features

* **Efficient Rendering**: Pre-calculates static elements and grid positions during setup to minimize per-frame computations.
* **Text Integration**: Works closely with `GameText` module to display dynamic information.
* **Relative Positioning**: Uses `RendererMetrics` to position itself relative to the main display.

== API Reference

=== `setup(rendererMetrics: RendererMetrics): void`

Initializes the renderer by calculating and storing static values.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`rendererMetrics` |`RendererMetrics` |The calculated layout metrics from `GameRenderer`.
|===

**Behavior**

Extracts relevant metrics (like cell size and HUD dimensions) and pre-calculates the screen coordinates for the HUD grid and its surrounding border to avoid recalculating them every frame.

=== `render(grid: Cell[][], modules: GameModules): void`

Orchestrates the rendering of the HUD components.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`grid` |`Cell[][]` |The main game grid (unused by HUD, but required by interface).
|`modules` |`GameModules` |Access to other modules like `Text`, `State`, and `Score`.
|===

**Behavior**

Calling this method triggers two internal processes:
1. `_renderHud`: Draws dynamic text elements (Score, Level, Paused state, etc.).
2. `_drawHudGrid`: Draws the visual grid on the HUD using the pre-calculated static values.
