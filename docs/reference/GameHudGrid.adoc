toc::[]

The `GameHudGrid` is a specialized implementation of the `GameGrid` class. It is hard-coded to a **4x4** dimension and is intended for use in the HUD area to display meta-information, such as "Next Piece" in a Tetris-style game.

== Inheritance

`GameHudGrid` extends xref:GameGrid.adoc[GameGrid]. It inherits all methods for filling areas, stamping pieces, and checking occupancy.

== Usage

Accessible via `modules.hudGrid`.

[source,typescript]
----
const { hudGrid } = this.modules;

// Reset HUD grid for a new piece
hudGrid.resetGrid();

// Stamp the "Next Piece" into the 4x4 HUD grid
hudGrid.stampPiece(nextPieceCoords, 1, Color.BLUE);
----

== Implementation Specifics

The `GameHudGrid` overrides the dimensions provided in the global configuration, strictly enforcing a 4x4 matrix. This ensures consistency for HUD-specific rendering logic.
