The `ControlInputHandlerHelper` manages the complexity of input timing, such as identifying the difference between a quick "press" and a sustained "hold".

== Usage

This helper is used by the `GameControl` module to normalize raw hardware events (like `keydown` and `keyup`) into engine-specific events.

== Methods

=== `handlePress(key: ControlKey): void`

Processes a new interaction with a specific key.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`key` |xref:../enums/ControlKey.adoc[ControlKey] |The virtual key being interacted with.
|===

**Behavior**

1.  Triggers the `PRESSED` event immediately.
2.  Starts a timer based on `configs.buttonHold.holdDelayMs`.
3.  If the key is still active after the delay, it starts an interval that repeatedly triggers the `HELD` event.

'''

=== `handleRelease(key: ControlKey): void`

Stops tracking an active interaction.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`key` |`ControlKey` |The key that was released.
|===

**Behavior**

Clears all active timers (delay and interval) for the specified key to stop `HELD` events from firing.
