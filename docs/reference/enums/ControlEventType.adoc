== General Usage

Crucial for distinguishing between actions like "Rotate Once" (`xref:../enums/ControlEventType.adoc[PRESSED]`) and "Move Continuously" (`xref:../enums/ControlEventType.adoc[HELD]`). Used in subscription filters: `xref:../modules/GameControl.adoc[modules.control].subscribe(key, ControlEventType.HELD, callback)`.
