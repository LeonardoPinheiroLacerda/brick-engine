Represents a collection of `xref:Cell.adoc[Cell]` objects that form a cohesive game piece or a pattern to be "stamped" onto the grid.

== Definition

[source,typescript]
----
export type Piece = Cell[];
----

== General Usage

The `Piece` type is the main unit of interaction for complex grid operations. By working with an array of `xref:Cell.adoc[Cell]` instead of raw `xref:Coordinate.adoc[Coordinate]`, the engine can preserve properties like color and value during movement and transformation.

Common operations involving pieces include:

* **Stamping**: Permanently applying the piece's cells to the grid.
* **Movement**: Shifting all cells within a piece simultaneously while checking for collisions.
* **Transformation**: Rotating, mirroring, or projecting the piece onto different grid locations.
