The `DisplayRenderer` is responsible for drawing the main game grid and the active bricks. It implements the standard `xref:../interfaces/modules/Renderer.adoc[Renderer]` interface and is managed by the `xref:GameRenderer.adoc[GameRenderer]`.

== API Reference

=== `setup(rendererMetrics: RendererMetrics): void`

Initializes the renderer and pre-calculates the static scene.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`rendererMetrics` |`xref:../types/RendererMetrics.adoc[RendererMetrics]` |The layout metrics calculated by `xref:GameRenderer.adoc[GameRenderer]`.
|===

**Behavior**

Stores the layout metrics for use during drawing. It also initializes an off-screen graphics buffer to pre-render the static background and borders, significantly improving performance by avoiding redundant draw calls every frame.


'''

=== `render(grid: Cell[][]): void`

Executes the main display drawing logic.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`grid` |`xref:../types/Cell.adoc[Cell][][]` |The current matrix of game cells.
|===

**Behavior**

1.  Renders the pre-cached static background.
2.  Iterates through the active `grid` state and draws each occupied cell using the previously stored metric offsets.
