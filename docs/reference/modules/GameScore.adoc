The `GameScore` module tracks player performance during a session. It manages the current score, game levels, multipliers, and acts as the authority for the game's `highScore`, persisting it directly to `LocalStorage`. It also fully supports Session serialization out of the box.

== API Reference

=== `score: number`

Read-only property returning the current session's points.


'''

=== `level: number`

Read-only property returning the current difficulty level.


'''

=== `multiplier: number`

Read and Write property for the current points multiplier.


'''

=== `highScore: number`

Read and Write property for the highest overall score achieved.

**Behavior**

When set, it automatically persists the value directly to `LocalStorage` under the `highScore` key. It does not use `GameState` for this persistence.


'''

=== `increaseScore(amount: number): void`

Adds points to the current session.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`amount` |`number` |Base points to add.
|===

**Behavior**

Increases the score by `amount * multiplier`. Automatically compares the new score against the internal `highScore` property and updates it if a new record is reached (which in turn persists the new record to `LocalStorage`).


'''

=== `resetScore(): void`

Resets the session score to zero.


'''

=== `increaseLevel(amount: number): void`

Increases the game difficulty level.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`amount` |`number` |Number of levels to add.
|===


'''

=== `resetLevel(): void`

Resets the level counter to 1.


'''

=== `getFormattedScore(digits: number): string`

Returns the score as a padded string suitable for HUD display.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`digits` |`number` |Total length of the string (e.g., 6 for "000150").
|===

**Returns**

`string` - The zero-padded score string.


'''

=== `serialize(): string`

**Behavior**

Implements `xref:../interfaces/Serializable.adoc[Serializable]`. Packs the current `score`, `level`, `max_level`, `multiplier`, and `highScore` into a JSON string to be managed by the active game session.


'''

=== `deserialize(data: string): void`

**Behavior**

Implements `xref:../interfaces/Serializable.adoc[Serializable]`. Restores all progress from a saved session string.


'''

=== `getDebugData(): Record<string, string | number | boolean>`

Returns metadata for the real-time debugger.
