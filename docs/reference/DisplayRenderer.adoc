The `DisplayRenderer` is responsible for drawing the main game grid and the active bricks. It implements the standard `Renderer` interface and is managed by the `GameRenderer`.

== API Reference

=== `setup(rendererMetrics: RendererMetrics): void`

Initializes the renderer and pre-calculates the static scene.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]

**Behavior**

Stores the layout metrics for use during drawing. It also initializes an off-screen graphics buffer to pre-render the static background and borders, significantly improving performance by avoiding redundant draw calls every frame.

|Name |Type |Description
|`grid` |`Cell[][]` |The current matrix of game cells.
