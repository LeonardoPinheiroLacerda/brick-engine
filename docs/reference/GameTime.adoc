The `GameTime` module manages the game loop timing. It separates game logic "ticks" from rendering frames, allowing for consistent game speed regardless of frame rate.

== Concepts

* **Tick**: A single step of game logic (e.g., moving a piece down one cell).
* **Tick Interval**: The time in milliseconds between ticks. A lower interval means the game runs faster.

== API Methods

=== Time Management

* `shouldTick()`: Returns `true` if enough time has passed since the last tick to run logic again.
* `update(deltaTime)`: Adds elapsed time to the internal accumulator. Called automatically by `Game`.

=== Speed Control

* `tickInterval`: Getter/Setter for the interval in ms.
** Example: `time.tickInterval = 500;` (2 ticks per second).
* `incrementTickInterval(amount)`: Increases the interval (slower game).
* `decrementTickInterval(amount)`: Decreases the interval (faster game).

This is commonly used to increase difficulty as the player progresses.

=== Performance

There is a `GameTimeWithPerformance` variant that tracks logic execution time, mostly used for debugging and profiling.
