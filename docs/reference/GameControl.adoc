toc::[]

The `GameControl` module handles user input from keyboard and virtual UI buttons. It provides an event-based system for reacting to player actions.

== Supported Keys (`ControlKey`)

The engine maps physical keys (Arrow keys, WASD, Space, Enter) to virtual keys:

* `UP` / `DOWN` / `LEFT` / `RIGHT`: Directional controls.
* `ACTION`: Primary action (e.g., Spacebar).
* `START_PAUSE`: Pausing or starting game (e.g., Enter/P).
* `RESET`: Reset game.
* `SOUND`: Toggle sound.
* `COLOR`: Toggle color mode.
* `POWER`: Turn console on/off.
* `EXIT`: Exit game (if supported by environment).

== Event Types (`ControlEventType`)

* `ControlEventType.PRESSED` (`'pressed'`): Triggered once when key is pressed.
* `ControlEventType.HELD` (`'held'`): Triggered repeatedly while key is held down (interval defined in config).

== API Methods

=== `subscribe(key, type, callback)`

Register a callback for a specific key and event type.

});
