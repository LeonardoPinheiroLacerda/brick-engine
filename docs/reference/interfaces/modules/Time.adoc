= Time Reference

Interface for managing the game's logical clock and update frequency.

== Properties

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`tickInterval` |`number` |The duration in milliseconds between logic updates.
|===

== Methods

=== `update(deltaTime: number): void`

Adds elapsed time to the internal accumulator. Called every frame.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`deltaTime` |`number` |Time in milliseconds since last frame.
|===


'''

=== `shouldTick(): boolean`

Returns `true` if the accumulator has exceeded the `tickInterval`, indicating a logic update is due.

**Returns**

`boolean` - `true` if a tick should occur.


'''

=== `reset(): void`

Clears the time accumulator. Useful during game restarts.


'''

=== `incrementTickInterval(amount: number): void`

Slows down the game by increasing the time between ticks.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`amount` |`number` |Milliseconds to add to the interval.
|===


'''

=== `decrementTickInterval(amount: number): void`

Speeds up the game by decreasing the time between ticks.

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`amount` |`number` |Milliseconds to subtract from the interval.
|===

== General Usage

Implemented by `xref:../../modules/GameTime.adoc[GameTime]`. This module ensures that game logic (like falling pieces) runs at a consistent speed regardless of the render frame rate.
