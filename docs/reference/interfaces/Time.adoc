== Methods

=== `update(deltaTime: number): void`
Adds elapsed time to the internal accumulator. Called every frame.

'''

=== `shouldTick(): boolean`
Returns `true` if the accumulator has exceeded the `tickInterval`, indicating a logic update is due.

'''

=== `reset(): void`
Clears the time accumulator. Useful during game restarts.

'''

=== `incrementTickInterval(amount: number): void`
Slows down the game by increasing the time between ticks.

'''

=== `decrementTickInterval(amount: number): void`
Speeds up the game by decreasing the time between ticks.

== General Usage

Implemented by `GameTime`. This module ensures that game logic (like falling pieces) runs at a consistent speed regardless of the render frame rate.
