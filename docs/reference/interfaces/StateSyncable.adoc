|`_state` |`State` |Internal reference to the state module.
|===

== Methods

=== `syncState(state: xref:modules/State.adoc[State]): void`

**Parameters**

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`state` |`xref:modules/State.adoc[State]` |The global state manager.
|===

== General Usage

Implemented by `xref:../modules/GameSound.adoc[GameSound]` and `xref:../modules/GameScore.adoc[GameScore]`. During the start-up sequence, the engine calls `syncState()` on these modules to ensure they have the latest references to `muted` flags and `highScore` data.
