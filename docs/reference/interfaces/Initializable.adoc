A fundamental contract for modules that require an assembly phase.

== Methods

=== `setup(): void`
Invoked once by the engine after all modules are constructed.

== General Usage

Modules implementing `Initializable` use the `setup()` phase to establish internal buffers, bind event listeners, or perform calculations that depend on final configuration values.
